# Slide Anvil — Critic Rules Reference

Lightweight rules-only reference for Slide Forge critic agents. For the full production skill (workflow, scripts, PptxGenJS), see slide-anvil.

## Rules to Enforce

All enforceable rules are defined in the canonical reference:
**[slide-anvil/references/rules.md](../slide-anvil/references/rules.md)**

When reviewing, check every rule in that document. Your verdict (PASS/FAIL) must reference specific rule sections by heading name (e.g., "Violation: Bullet Plan Syntax -- used en-dash instead of hyphen-minus").

For full examples and writing patterns, see:
**[slide-anvil/references/style-guide.md](../slide-anvil/references/style-guide.md)**
